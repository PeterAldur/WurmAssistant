GENERAL:
- choice where to install
- configuration wizard on first run
- embedded python interpreter
- linux and macOS support
- guides / videopresentation for every module

TIMERS
- counter for prayers today
- repeat sound warning option
- grooming reminder
- question timer recognizing failures as well

SOUND NOTIFY
- extensible queue sound conditions list

GRANGER
- option to ignore inbreeding with general "horse" and "hellhorse"
- generational inbreeding? does such thing exist?
- warnings for diseased
- age tracking, foal check for breeding
- dedicated color column
- support for alts
- exporting to TXT

DKSprocket:
Would it be possible to add a column (possibly optional) where we can enter the color of the horse? 
It could default to "Unkown" if we haven't set it manually. Bonus point if the color selection actually 
colored something so it would be easy to see all the colors in a herd. I know the comment field could be used, 
but this would make it a lot more convenient. I am not asking for breeding suggestions for colors, just a manual 
field to help keep track.

Nomadikhan suggestion:

Perhaps, something to parse skill gains.  Maybe have it record average skillgain per hour.  
It'd be nice to see, for example, my average gains on an iron vein for an hour, 
then switch and see my average gains on a lead vein the next hour.  
Useful for putting all these "perfect skillgain" myths to rest.

Also, for combat, record hits, misses, parries, glances... to yield an overall hit ratio?  
Trivial maybe, but would be interesting to see my average hit percentage in a given hunting trip or pvp skirmish.  
The same for block, to see an averaged block ratio/percentage.

track medit path advance cooldown (missing question failures still)
autostart? seems not to work

Maru suggestion:

So, the feature I was talking about would allow the user to choose a specific search term and display information 
about that search easily through the UI for quick reference.

For instance, let's say I want to know the total number of saplings I've planted. I would choose to edit the frame 
which I want to display the number. I would enter the string, "You have planted a sapling." I would choose 
that I wanted to display the number of times that string appears in my event log. Perhaps I could choose that I want 
to display the number of times that string is found in the logs but only for the past day, or hour. 

I wish I could be more clear. Basically, I want to see a persistent UI element which displays information related 
to custom log searches based on user string entry, time & date and other data related to a search, like the number of times 
a string is found in the logs.
