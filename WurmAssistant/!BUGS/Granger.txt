---------

- My animal husbandry skill isn't detected correctly - probably a decimal point problem since I use , instead of . for decimals? (my skill is 35.84)
[12:29:59] ! Granger: Animal husbandry skill was adjusted from 358460 to 100
[12:29:59] Granger: found out Geisha AH skill to be: 100

[12:43:12] Animal husbandry increased by 0,00780 to 35,8539

> recoded skill numbers parsing to be fully culture invariant: 1.4.0.18

---------

- Small nusiance - the trait panel of the default screen doesn't resize to show all 3 columns until I reduce the size of the first column (it shows a scroll bar at the bottom of the window). 
Resizing/maxmizing the granger window doesn't fix it since the vertical separator seems to be undragable.
